I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss a challenge I've been facing with data segregation. The descriptions I work with daily are quite extensive, requiring attention to detail due to various factors such as dimensions, materials, and inconsistent formatting.

Moreover, the continuous strain on my eyes from closely monitoring the system has been impacting my efficiency, contributing to a lower daily target achievement. I believe addressing this issue could significantly enhance my productivity.
